### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests and ensure they pass
5. Add or update relevant tests
6. Add or update documentation
7. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentinel.git
   cd sentinel
   ```

2. Set up Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   poetry install --extras=sbert
   poetry env activate
   ```

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[sbert]"
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Write docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Add type hints to function signatures
- Write unit tests for new functionality

## Testing

- Run tests with pytest:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

- Check code coverage:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=sentinel tests/
  ```

## Documentation

- Update documentation for any changes to the API
- Document new features with examples
- Keep the README updated with any major changes
- Always update docstrings when changing function behavior or parameters

### Automatic Documentation Updates

The project has automated tools to keep documentation in sync with code:

1. A pre-commit hook will automatically update RST files when docstrings change
2. You can manually update docs by running (from the project root):
   ```bash
   # From the project root
   python docs/generate_docs.py
   ```

3. To build the HTML documentation (from the docs directory):
   ```bash
   # From the docs directory
   make html
   ```

4. To both generate and build documentation in one step (from the docs directory):
   ```bash
   # From the docs directory
   make update
   ```

The CI pipeline will verify that documentation is up-to-date when pull requests are opened or updated. The pre-commit hook ensures that documentation stays in sync with your code changes automatically.

## Release Process

The maintainers will handle releases following semantic versioning.

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing, please open an issue or reach out to the maintainers.
